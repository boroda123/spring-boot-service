# spring-boot-service
Sample implementation of a simple Spring Boot service


The project can be run
1. Locally from an IDE
2. As a Docker container (MySQL instance included)
3. As AWS service new image is built and deployed on "push" to the "main" branch

Currently, the service is deployed as:
https://k7b3riigaa.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/

It has both HAL Explorer (https://k7b3riigaa.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/explorer/index.html#uri=/)
and Swagger (https://k7b3riigaa.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/swagger-ui/index.html) connected

A simple React application (react-app) can be used as UI to drive this service.
